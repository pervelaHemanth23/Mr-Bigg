# Mr. Bigg

A repo for my GMTK Game Jam 2024 Submission

## What is this game about?

This is an Action game made on the topic "Built To Scale" for GMTK Game Jam 2024.

In this game, you are madman whose sole goal is to destroy the city. So you have various guns you can use to destroy the buildings and each one gets better and better until you can level the whole city in a matter of seconds. 

Thanks for playing my game. Any feedback and suggestions are most welcome. 

Due to more experience and time, i was able to create my own assets and work on a game that uses physics for the first time
